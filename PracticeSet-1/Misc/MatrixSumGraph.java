/* Given a random MxN matrix and a positive integer, recursively Your program
should then find a continuous path thought the matrix starting at position 0,0
that will sum to n. Your program shouldomly move left (col -1), right(col +1),
up (row -1) and down (row+1)and can only use a position once in the sum. if
there is a such path in the matrix, create the path in a separate matrix with
the same size, and replacing the indices used with 1 and the rest 0. */
